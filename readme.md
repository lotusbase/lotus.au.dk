## Developer notes
### Building with Grunt
*Lotus* Base uses Grunt.js for building. Resources that are served with *Lotus* Base, i.e. CSS and JS files, images and fonts, are located in the `src/` directory. You will need to install and run `grunt` in order to build them into a usable form before deployment. Please refer to [building with Grunt](#markdown-header-building-with-grunt).

Install all the dependencies using `npm install`, and then run `grunt dev` or `grunt prod` as of when needed. If on-the-fly builds are desired, use `grunt watch` instead.
