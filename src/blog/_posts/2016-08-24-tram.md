The availability of various versions of the *L. japonicus* genome, while proving to be an important resource in legume research, makes it difficult for users to map annotated genes and/or transcripts from one version to another. The [Transcript Mapper (TRAM) tool](/tools/tram) can be used for exactly this purpose, and we currently support versions 2.5 and 3.0. As with all the other tooklits provided with *Lotus* Base, TRAM provides deep-linking to other tools for your convenience.
