The LORE1 databases (both v2.5 and v3.0) have undergone massive restructuring, in line with efforts to atomize database entries and normalize all databases. New lines have been added to the v3.0 database, with almost a doubling of the database size, growing from 140,000 rows to slightly more than 240,000 rows. Databases have been reindexed to optimize search performance.

It is now possible to know if the insertion has occured in an intron in the v3.0 database, an aim the team has been working towards for quite a few months. You can also check for the annotations for particular genes.

New Japanese lines have also been inserted into the v3.0 database, but they are unavailable for ordering.
