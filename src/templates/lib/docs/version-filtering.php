<p>Note: for <em>L. japonicus</em> MG20, we only allow searches from v3.0 onwards, due to incomplete mapping of v2.5 between our available datasets. When no versions are selected, we assume you are querying all versions.</p>
<p class="user-message warning">You may query across multiple versions at the same time. <strong>However, note that the genomic coordinates are incompatible between different versions.</strong></p>
